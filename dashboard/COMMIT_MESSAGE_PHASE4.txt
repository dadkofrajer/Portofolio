feat: Add enhanced features for essay management (Phase 4)

Implement comprehensive UX improvements including essay creation modal,
delete confirmation dialog, auto-save functionality, and enhanced visual
feedback throughout the essay manager.

New Components:
- CreateEssayModal: Full-featured form for creating new essays with support
  for both general and college-specific essays. Includes validation and
  proper form handling.
- DeleteConfirmDialog: Custom styled confirmation dialog replacing browser's
  native confirm(). Shows essay context and clear warnings about permanent
  deletion.

Enhanced Features:
- Auto-save: Debounced auto-save (2s delay) for essay content and Google
  Doc URLs. Prevents data loss and improves UX.
- Save status indicators: Real-time feedback showing "Unsaved changes",
  "Saving...", or "Saved Xm ago" with color-coded status.
- Word count validation: Enhanced visual warnings when over word limit
  including red text, border highlights, and over-limit messages.
- Status auto-update: Automatically updates essay status based on word
  count progress (Not Started → In Progress → Complete).

Technical Improvements:
- Proper React hooks management with useCallback and useRef for auto-save
- Modal state management with proper cleanup
- Enhanced form handling with controlled components
- Improved error prevention and user feedback

Files Changed:
- components/essays/CreateEssayModal.tsx (new)
- components/essays/DeleteConfirmDialog.tsx (new)
- components/essays/EssayEditor.tsx (enhanced)
- app/essays/page.tsx (integrated modals)

This completes Phase 4 of the essay manager feature implementation,
providing a polished and user-friendly experience for managing college
application essays.
